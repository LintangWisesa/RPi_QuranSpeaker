### 1. System requirements

Install Docker and Docker Compose using [this](https://dev.to/rohansawant/installing-docker-and-docker-compose-on-the-raspberry-pi-in-5-simple-steps-3mgl) guide.

### 2. (Optional) Download mp3 files

Follow the same instructions in the original tutorial.
You can skip this step if you are going to use the streaming option only.
